# Changelog

## 1.3.0

- **Speaker now displays the station name and logo.** Each `Play` call
  carries DIDL-Lite metadata (`dc:title`, `upnp:albumArtURI`,
  `audioBroadcast` class). Station name + favicon are auto-fetched from
  [radio-browser.info](https://www.radio-browser.info/) by stream URL
  at startup and cached for the session.
- **Trigger presets from Home Assistant.** The add-on connects to the
  Supervisor-provided MQTT broker (Mosquitto add-on) and publishes Home
  Assistant MQTT-discovery configs so each preset auto-appears as a
  `button.bose_<id>_preset_N` entity. Press the entity in HA → bridge
  plays the same URL it would play on a physical button press.
  Requires the Mosquitto Broker add-on running and the MQTT integration
  configured in HA (the standard auto-discovery setup).
- The add-on declares `services: ["mqtt:need"]` so the Supervisor
  injects MQTT credentials automatically — no manual configuration.
  Falls back gracefully if MQTT is unavailable (logs a warning, only
  physical buttons keep working).

## 1.2.1

- Fix multi-architecture build. The `1.2.0` Dockerfile only pulled the
  amd64 base image and failed on aarch64 (ARM64) Home Assistant
  installations. Re-added `build.yaml` mapping each supported
  architecture to its correct base image.
- Dropped deprecated `armv7`, `armhf`, `i386` from `arch` (modern
  Supervisor flags these). Supported architectures are now `amd64` and
  `aarch64`.

## 1.2.0

- Polished release for public use.
- Auto-discovers the SoundTouch via SSDP if `bose_host` is left blank.
- Auto-derives the UPnP description URL from the speaker's `/info`
  endpoint — works on any SoundTouch model out of the box.
- Removed deprecated `build.yaml` (FROM image inlined into Dockerfile).
- Default config is now empty so first-time users can paste their own
  URLs.

## 1.1.0

- Added 6 configurable preset URL fields and a `bose_host` field via the
  add-on **Configuration** tab.

## 1.0.0

- Initial WebSocket → UPnP bridge with hardcoded URL map.
